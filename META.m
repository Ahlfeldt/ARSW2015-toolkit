    % solves for 1986 transformed wages and finds epsilon that results in
    % adjusted 1986 Bezirke wages with the same log variance as observed in

        % section6/comegaopt.m: Finds the transformed wages for given

% Calibration %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    % Uses a sequential procedure that is didactically useful

        % solving for wages
        % These amenities and productivities ensure that the model recovers 
        % initial values of endogneous variables
    % We compare recovered productivities and amenities to those recovered

    % Unlike in in the case with exogenous fundamentals
        % we now use the GMM estimates of the full model in the
        % quantification of the model
    % We decompose the amenities and productivities in an ednogenous and an
        % exogenous part
    % We illustrate how after accounting for endogenous components,
        % fundamentals are "flat" (not much correlated with CBD distance)
    % We compare productivities and amenities under the GMM parametrization
        % to those obtained under parameter values from Section 6

        % An upgrade to fundamental productivity in East Berlin: We
