			In the same sort order as in all Matlab files
			This is essential for mapping straight out of Matlab
			Use this shapefile when applying the MAPIT function!

BerlinGreen:		Blocks covered by green spaces. Used by MAPIT.m programme to create 
			better-looking maps that provide improved orientation

BerlinWater:		Blocks covered by water. Used by MAPIT.m programme to create 
			better-looking maps that provide improved orientation
